# Comparative Performance Analysis of Python, C++, Java, and Go

This repository provides a side-by-side comparison of four major programming languages â€” **Python**, **C++**, **Java**, and **Go** â€” in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and profiling insights. The comparison includes both a compute-intensive task (matrix multiplication) and a real-world data analysis example (India VIX analysis).

## ðŸ“Š Performance Comparison Table

| Language | Fibonacci Time | Data Analysis Time | Memory Used |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Python   | 0.1883 s       | 0.031 s            | 2.36 MB     |
| Java     | 2.258 s        | 0.133 s            | 1.00 MB     |
| Go       | 5.3322 ms      | 0.042 s            | 2.30 MB     |
| C++      | 0.017 s        | 0.100 s            | 0.16 MB     |

## ðŸ“Š Profiling Tools Used

| Language | Profiling Tool                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Python   | `memory_profiler`, `time` module         |
| Java     | **JVisualVM** (Memory, CPU, GC, Threads) |
| Go       | `runtime`, `pprof`, `memstats`           |
| C++      | Visual Studio Profiler                   |

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

### Python

```bash
pip install memory_profiler
python matrix_profiled.py
```

### Java

```bash
# Compile
javac VIXAnalysis.java
# Run
java VIXAnalysis
```

Use **JVisualVM** to attach to the process.

### Go

```bash
go run main.go
```

Enable profiling with `net/http/pprof` if needed.

### C++

Run the executable with **Visual Studio Profiler** attached:

```cpp
matrix_analysis.exe
```

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways

* C++ outperforms in both memory efficiency and raw execution speed.
* Go has extremely fast execution with minimal runtime overhead.
* Python is easy to write but is slower and uses more memory.
* Java has moderate performance but benefits from JVM profiling tools.
